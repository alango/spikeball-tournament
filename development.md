## Development Notes

### MVP Definition
- **Minimum Viable Product**: Phases 1-5 constitute the MVP
- **Target**: Functional tournament management with basic UI
- **Timeline**: Focus on getting MVP working before adding polish

### Testing Strategy
- Write tests incrementally during each phase
- Focus on algorithm correctness in Phase 3
- Add UI tests in Phases 4-6
- Integration tests in Phase 7-8

### Risk Mitigation
- **Algorithm Complexity**: Phase 3 is the highest risk - allocate extra time
- **State Management**: Test persistence thoroughly in Phase 7
- **Performance**: Monitor algorithm performance with larger datasets

### Deployment Strategy
- Deploy early and often starting with Phase 4
- Use feature flags for incomplete features
- Maintain staging and production environments
